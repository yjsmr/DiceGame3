 * User can choose how many rounds the user wants to play.
 * The game starts with a random integer between 1 to 6. Which is the value of the computers die.
 * Another random integer in the same range is cast and this is the value of the players die.
 * If dice is of the same value it will be a tie (but is still in the final result)
 * Program keeps count on who wins and will declare if itâ€™s the player or the computer
